About Monogatari
Our Story Begins with a Story
In Japanese, Monogatari means “story.” For us, it’s more than a name—it’s a philosophy. Born amidst the lush landscapes and cultural richness of Kerala, India, Monogatari is a fashion brand that threads tales of tradition, nature, artistry, and individuality into every piece we create.
Monogatari was founded with a powerful idea: Fashion isn’t just what you wear. It’s what you carry—your story, your spirit, your heritage.

Our Purpose
We exist to revive, reimagine, and retell stories through fabric, form, and feeling. Each collection is a chapter. Each piece, a verse. Together, they write your narrative—one of elegance, confidence, and purpose.

Rooted in Kerala, Designed for the World
Monogatari is proudly based in Kerala—a land where art, nature, and philosophy intertwine. We channel inspiration from Kannur’s handloom traditions, the tranquility of Munnar, and the color of Onam. Yet, our vision is global. We blend heritage with minimalism, artisanry with edge, and tradition with a contemporary voice.

What We Stand For
Craftsmanship Over Convention: We partner with local artisans to create lasting pieces of art.
Sustainability is Style: Ethical fabrics, eco-conscious packaging, and minimal waste are our essentials.
Minimal, Meaningful Design: Clean lines, earthy palettes, and soulful textures define our work.
Clothing for All Genders & Journeys: Our pieces empower every voice, every identity.
Our Process
We begin every collection with a theme, a feeling, or a forgotten cultural fragment. From research to sketches to working with weavers and dyers, we ensure nothing is rushed, nothing is wasted, nothing is soulless.

Meet the Founders
Monogatari was founded by Kerala-born creatives—designers, storytellers, and artists—who dreamt of translating their heritage into global design. Growing up amidst mundus, murals, monsoons, and Malayalam poetry, they now shape fashion that is soulful and timeless.

Beyond Fashion
Monogatari is a movement toward mindful living. It celebrates individuality, honors culture, protects the planet, and whispers:

“You are not just what you wear. You are the story you choose to tell.”
